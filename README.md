## Instructions
This is a matching memory game. Once the player clicks the first card, a timer begins as well as a moves tracker that records how many clicks the player has taken.

If the player clicks two cards consecutively that match, the cards will remain flipped over. If the cards do not match, both will be flipped back over until they've been matched. Once all cards have been successfully matched, the timer will stop.

The player will begin the game with three stars. Once the player has clicked 20 cards, one star will be removed. After the player has clicked 32 cards, another star will be removed. If the player clicks more than 60 times, all stars will be removed.
